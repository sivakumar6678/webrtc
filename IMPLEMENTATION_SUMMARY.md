# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### Backend (FastAPI + WebSocket Signaling)
- **File**: `server/main.py`
- **WebSocket endpoint**: `/ws` for signaling
- **Static file serving**: Serves `frontend/dist/` files
- **Room management**: Stores connections by `roomId`
- **SDP exchange**: Handles offers, answers, and ICE candidates
- **Connection tracking**: Manages desktop and phone connections

### Frontend (React + WebRTC)
- **File**: `frontend/dist/index.html` (single-file build)
- **Desktop page** (`/`):
  - Generates unique `roomId`
  - Displays QR code with join URL
  - WebRTC PeerConnection as receiver
  - Video display element
- **Phone page** (`/join/:roomId`):
  - Camera permission request
  - Video capture with `getUserMedia`
  - WebRTC PeerConnection as sender
  - Real-time signaling

### Infrastructure
- **Start script**: `./start.sh wasm`
- **Dependencies**: All installed in `server/venv/`
- **Static build**: No Node.js build required
- **HTTPS ready**: Works with ngrok for phone access

## 🔧 Key Components

### WebRTC Flow
1. Desktop opens `/` → generates `roomId` → shows QR code
2. Phone scans QR → opens `/join/:roomId` → requests camera
3. Both connect to WebSocket `/ws`
4. Phone creates offer → Desktop creates answer
5. ICE candidates exchanged → P2P connection established
6. Phone video stream appears on desktop

### Signaling Messages
- `join`: Client joins room with type (desktop/phone)
- `offer`: WebRTC offer from phone to desktop
- `answer`: WebRTC answer from desktop to phone
- `ice-candidate`: ICE candidates for NAT traversal
- `user-joined`/`user-left`: Connection status updates

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Start server
./start.sh wasm

# 2. In another terminal, expose with ngrok
ngrok http 8000

# 3. Open ngrok HTTPS URL on desktop
# 4. Scan QR code with phone
# 5. Grant camera permission
# 6. Video stream appears on desktop
```

### Manual Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd server
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start server
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Expose with ngrok
ngrok http 8000
```

## ✅ Requirements Met

1. **Phone → Browser streaming**: ✅ Working WebRTC P2P connection
2. **QR code generation**: ✅ Desktop shows QR with join URL
3. **Camera capture**: ✅ Phone requests and captures video
4. **WebSocket signaling**: ✅ SDP and ICE candidate exchange
5. **Static file serving**: ✅ Backend serves frontend files
6. **HTTPS compatibility**: ✅ Works with ngrok for phone access
7. **Minimal dependencies**: ✅ No heavy libraries, plain WebRTC APIs
8. **One-command start**: ✅ `./start.sh wasm`

## 🔄 Next Steps (Future Phases)

- **Phase 3**: Add canvas overlay for bounding boxes
- **Phase 4**: Integrate WASM object detection (onnxruntime-web)
- **Phase 5**: Add FPS and latency metrics
- **Phase 6**: Export metrics to JSON
- **Phase 7**: Optional server-side detection mode

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

1. **QRCode library loading**: 
   - ✅ Fixed CDN URL (cloudflare with proper async loading)
   - ✅ Added proper async/await QR generation
   - ✅ Added loading placeholder and error handling
   - ✅ Enhanced QR code styling and display
   - ✅ Added QR Server API fallback
   - ✅ Added canvas-based visual fallback
   - ✅ Added library status debugging

2. **Video not visible on desktop (black screen)**:
   - ✅ Enhanced video element configuration
   - ✅ Added onloadedmetadata handler with forced play
   - ✅ Improved WebRTC stream handling with track logging
   - ✅ Added comprehensive video event handlers
   - ✅ Better stream debugging and error reporting

3. **Video not visible on mobile**:
   - ✅ Added proper local video playback
   - ✅ Enhanced camera stream setup
   - ✅ Better track management and logging
   - ✅ Improved video element event handlers

4. **Mobile camera mirroring**:
   - ✅ Removed transform: scaleX(-1) 
   - ✅ Natural camera view for better object detection

5. **Video quality improvements**:
   - ✅ Set ideal resolution (640x480)
   - ✅ Set ideal frame rate (30fps)
   - ✅ Better camera constraints

6. **Enhanced debugging**:
   - ✅ Added ICE connection state logging
   - ✅ Added video load event handlers
   - ✅ Better error messages and status updates
   - ✅ Comprehensive WebRTC track logging
   - ✅ WebSocket message debugging

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

1. **Camera not working**: Ensure HTTPS (use ngrok)
2. **WebSocket errors**: Check server is running on port 8000
3. **No video on desktop**: Check browser console for detailed WebRTC logs
4. **Connection issues**: Ensure both devices can reach signaling server
5. **QRCode not showing**: Check console for QRCode library loading status

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- ✅ Desktop displays QR code
- ✅ Phone can scan and join room
- ✅ Camera permission requested and granted
- ✅ WebRTC connection established
- ✅ Phone video stream appears on desktop
- ✅ Real-time video streaming works
- ✅ Connection status updates shown
- ✅ Works over HTTPS with ngrok
